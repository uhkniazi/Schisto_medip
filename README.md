# Schisto_medip
MEDIP-Seq data analysis from Schistosoma mansoni S, M and F lifecycle stages

# 00_header.R
header file to set libraries, source files and set global variables and paths

# 01_dismiss_to_gff.R
one of the first scripts in the series. used to generate an initial profile of the medip data after being processed by dismiss. 
it will generate some plots based on the peak distribution (ie. counts) in the three lifecycle stages. furthermore, based on the
initial filtering criteria, it will choose peaks (if they are present in 3 of 3, 2 of 3 or 1 of 3 replicates) and further
subdivide them into groups i.e. peaks present in all 3 lifecycle stages, 2, 1 etc. it also generates a gff which can be used
for further analysis in a genome browser and an object file used for next scripts.

# Schisto_medip_classes.R
contains functions and classes used by the script.
CFeatures - a class inherited from GRanges, and holds the feature information for the genome i.e. exon, intron etc. this
information was extracted from the gff file from sanger Schistosoma_mansoni_v5.2.gff
